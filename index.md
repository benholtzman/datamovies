## datamovies

This repository is for code for my class at the Computer Music Center, Columbia University, called "Sonic and Visual Representation of Data". I'll post examples and code and stuff... and links to specific projects.

Datamovies is my new, nice and obvious term for what I and friends have been doing for a long time: generating sonic and visual representations of data. I tried 'data talkies' but it needs more explaining because the kidz don't know what a 'talkie' is. datamovies. Simple.
