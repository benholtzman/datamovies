### datamovies
This package includes a couple of demo codes for sonifying data, written by Ben Holtzman (https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~benh/) and others.

The codes in this package are in the form of Jupyter Notebooks, which are becoming the most popular way to write and share PYTHON code within the scientific community. The easiest way to install Jupyter Notebook is by installing Anaconda -- it is included with Anaconda. To download Anaconda, visit https://www.anaconda.com/download/

Once downloaded, run the Jupyter Notebook by typing in the Mac Terminal (or Command Prompt for Windows):

`jupyter notebook`

## Required PYTHON Packages for this demo
- numpy        (https://anaconda.org/anaconda/numpy)
- scipy        (https://anaconda.org/anaconda/scipy)
- matplotlib   (https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/matplotlib)
- librosa      (https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/librosa)
- resampy      (https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/resampy)

The easiest way to download these packages is using Anaconda (see above). Click the link next to each code name above and copy and paste the corresponding command into the terminal. For example, to install numpy type this into the Mac Terminal:

`conda install -c anaconda numpy`
