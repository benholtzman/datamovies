# ## (5) Looking at the sound: The Fourier Transform ! 

# In[20]:

from scipy import fftpack as spfft # for computing spectra
#from scipy import signal as spsig

########## First do the Fourier transform = look at the frequency content of the entire signal
# We do a fast Fourier transform (FFT)

Nfft = 1000 # Number of points (discrete frequencies) on which to compute the FFT 
# (actually twice the number of frequency point we need, but that's another story). Better if it's a power of 2
sr = fs
f = np.arange(-Nfft/2,Nfft/2,1)*sr/Nfft 
# the discretized vector of frequencies: contains negative and positive frequencies 
# (see mathematical definition of the Fourier transform)

# FFT computation -> gives the spectrum S
S = spfft.fft(y, n=Nfft)
# S is an array of complex numbers, containing the amplitude for each frequency bin in f, but in another order... 
# First positive frequency bins, then negative frequency bins...

# Let's consider only positive frequencies
f = f[int(len(f)/2):] 
S = S[:int(len(S)/2)] 
# Now f covers the (discretized) frequency range from 0 to sr/2 Hz (see Nyquist theorem, Nyquist frequency)

########## Finally plot the spectrum
plt.figure(figsize=(9,5))
plt.plot(f,np.absolute(S),'k') # Since S is complex-valued, we have to choose between the absolute value and phase
plt.xlabel('Frequency (Hz)')
plt.ylabel('Amplitude (linear)')
plt.xlim([0,sr/6])

plt.figure(figsize=(9,5))
plt.plot(f,20*np.log10(np.absolute(S)),'k') # Take the log10 with numpy, and have a factor 20 because we're dealing with acoustic pressure (L = 20log10(p/pref)) and not intensity (L = 10log10(p/pref))
plt.xlabel('Frequency (Hz)')
plt.ylabel('Amplitude (dB)')
plt.xlim([0,sr/6])


# ## (5) Looking at the sound: The Spectrogram ! 

# The "problem" with FFT is that it averages the frequency content over the whole signal. We completely lose the 
# information of time.
# 
# so... Short Term Fourier Transform (STFT).
# 
# The idea is to cut the signal into successive time frames and perform an FFT for each frame
# Involves quite a bit of mathematical stuff which we will ingeniously skip here...
# 
# See here for a graphical explanation https://www.researchgate.net/figure/231828310_fig7_Figure-7-Short-time-Fourier-transform-STFT-with-envelope-and-two-sample-overlap
# 
# And the well-known "spectrogram" is only a graphical representation of the STFT. 

# In[21]:

from scipy import signal as spsig

# Let's compute the spectrogram
NfftSTFT = 4096 # The number of frequency points for the FFT of each frame
SliceLength = int(0.05*fs) # The length of each frame (should be expressed in samples)
Overlap = int(SliceLength/4) # The overlapping between successive frames (should be expressed in samples)
[fSTFT, tSTFT, STFT] = spsig.spectrogram(y, fs=sr, nperseg=SliceLength, noverlap=Overlap, nfft=NfftSTFT) 
# also provides associated f and t vectors!

# Let's plot the spectrogram
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.pcolormesh(tSTFT,fSTFT,20*np.log10(np.absolute(STFT)))

#plt.xlim([0,dur1-SliceLength/sr])
plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
plt.ylabel('Frequency (Hz)')
cbar = plt.colorbar()
cbar.ax.set_ylabel('dB', rotation=270)


# ## (6) modulate the amplitude with an envelope ! 

# In[22]:

# 1) make a curve that will be the envelope, of the same length as the original signal
N = len(y)
envelope = np.zeros(N)
print(envelope.shape)
peak = int(N/6)
print(peak)

# from 0 to the peak index (peak):
up = np.linspace(0,1,peak)
print(up.shape)
envelope[:peak] = up

# and fill in the rest: 
down = np.linspace(1,0,(N-peak))
print(down.shape)
envelope[peak:] = down

# plot the envelope
plt.figure(figsize=(9,5))
plt.plot(envelope,'k') 
plt.xlabel('time [s]')
plt.ylabel('amplitude of wave')

# modulate the signal by multiplication
ym = y*envelope

# plot the wave
plt.figure(figsize=(9,5))
plt.plot(ym,'k') 
plt.xlabel('time [s]')
plt.ylabel('amplitude of wave')
plt.grid()

# make the sound
outfile = 'sound_env.wav'
fs = int(1/dt) # must be an integer ! 
a_scale = 0.9
librosa.output.write_wav(outfile, ym*a_scale, fs, norm=False)


# ## (7) PLOT THE SPECTROGRAM OF THE envelope modulated signal

# Let's compute the spectrogram

SliceLength = int(0.05*fs) # The length of each frame (should be expressed in samples)
